# Slot-Machine Excercise

---

## Objective

The main objective is to learn vet,props and JSX.

### Steps

The Slots component is designed to handle three input values and determine the outcome based on their equality. If all three values are the same, it renders a congratulatory message along with the result. If the values are different, it indicates a loss. The component follows these rules:

- Displays input values in `<h1>` elements.
- Dynamically styles the outcome: green for winners and red for losers.
- Renders the congratulatory message in a `<h3>` element, styled with blue when applicable.
