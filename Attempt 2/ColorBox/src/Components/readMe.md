## ColorBox Excercise

This repository contains a simple exercise focused on state management in React. The objective is to create a grid of colored boxes, where each box changes its background color randomly upon clicking.

## Instructions

- Start by creating a single box component named `Box`.
- Utilize a piece of state within each `Box` component to keep track of the background color.
- When a box is clicked, it should update its background color to a random color.
- You can pass a numBoxes as a prop to the BoxGrid component.
- After implementing the `Box` component, proceed to create a component named `BoxGrid` or similar. This component will render multiple instances of `Box` based on numvalue.
- The styling for arranging the boxes in a grid layout (using Flexbox or CSS Grid) is not the primary focus, but you can apply basic styles as desired.
